            <p class="intro">
                Python-powered robots are widely used in automation, research, and AI-driven applications. The simplicity and versatility of Python make it ideal for integrating robotics with sensors, actuators, and AI-based decision-making systems.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Hardware Integration & Control</strong> Python libraries like RPi.GPIO and pySerial enable communication with sensors, motors, and microcontrollers, allowing robots to interact with their environment.</li>
                <li><strong>Computer Vision & AI</strong>With OpenCV and TensorFlow, robots can recognize objects, navigate autonomously, and make intelligent decisions using real-time image processing and machine learning.</li>
                <li><strong>Motion Planning & Navigation</strong> Libraries such as ROS (Robot Operating System) and Pygame help in path planning, obstacle avoidance, and autonomous movement in dynamic environments.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Automation & IoT Connectivity</strong> Robots can be controlled remotely using MQTT, WebSockets, or cloud-based APIs, making them suitable for smart home applications, industry automation, and remote operations.</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="footer-text">
                This project demonstrates the power of AI in real-world applications, particularly in automation, industrial robots, and home assistant robots. It represents the future of robotics, where machines can think, learn, and act autonomously to perform useful tasks with minimal human intervention.
            </p>
            <p>From self-driving vehicles to industrial automation, Python enables robots to perform complex tasks efficiently. By leveraging AI, IoT, and real-time data processing, these robots continuously evolve, improving precision and adaptability in various real-world scenarios.</p>
